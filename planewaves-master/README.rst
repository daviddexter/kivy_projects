PlaneWaves
==========

PlaneWaves is a simple kivy app displaying plane waves via GLSL shaders. You can click/tap to create wavevector markers and move them around to change the wavevector magnitudes. The superposition of all the wavevectors is displayed - you can see just the intensity, or the complex phase, or the phase modulated by intensity.
